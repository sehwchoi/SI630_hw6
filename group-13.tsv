Documentaries	cin8eq0	> Where are all the videos of US troops shouting Murica fuck yea while bombing the Iraqis and Afghans in the last 20 years! >   This doesnt bolster his claim, but Americas influence has been disgraceful.    <link> 	reddit-Sethex	cin8qkh	From what I can find, it still pales in comparison to what happened under Saddam.    <link> 	reddit-Panaka	cin8vqd	It is an interesting apologist strategy to imply essentially: those people would have died anyways as a result of our sanctions!   <link> 
dbz	dkxb2w9	Caulifla and Kale are part of a gang, thus theyre like a family in that regard. Kale considers Caulifla like a big sis to a little sis and gets jealous when someone is trying to steer her sis away from her. Clearly she got over her insecurities and manage to gain some control over the SSJBerserk form, as we saw. I cant wait to see Kales growth now! <3 	reddit-RenektonGod	dkxdrzt	Actually yeah that would make a great deal of sense.	reddit-PhoenixHunter89	dkxeaku	Yee, I dont get why people instantly assume its a lesbian relationship when sibling jealousy has been a thing that Ive seen a lot more often in other stories. <__> But oh well, this makes more sense. I like it. I cant wait for more. 
cripplingalcoholism	d5qmdl1	Ugh, hope youre feeling a little better tonight. Its the absolute worst.	reddit-ladystaggers	d5r6hai	Slept like ass, just had a vegetable smoothie which similarly tasted like ass, but I need me those vitamins and good stuff, so a necessary evil. Thanks, comrade. 	reddit-Stratahoo	d5rvwbm	Thats how you do it man! Good job.
childfree	cb3sqxx	Ive actually had someone suggest that I have a kid to solve my financial issues before... because Id get govt. assistance if I did. lol I feels ya!!!!  Hope it works out somehow!!!	reddit-ChokuRei	cb3ssvy	Yep, Ive been told the same thing.  A pretty sick reason to bring a person into the world, isnt it?  They never see it that way, though.  Thank you.  As soon as I posted this, one of the places called back to reschedule an interview for next week.  Im so grateful theyre giving me the opportunity.  :D	reddit-HellaBex	cb3ua01	YAY!!!!!! good luck!
Paranormal	cb4ptm4	Sometimes kid toys can go off for no reason, even if no button is pressed. When batteries are low it can affect it.	reddit-hollyyy95	cb4pxcv	Still doesnt explain the sound of it being dropped into my toy box.	reddit-Jake6661	cb4q1jq	Oh yeah sorry I missed that. There could have been a shift with the weight of the toys on top, but that would not have been as loud as a toy being dropped in there

MakeupAddiction	ctjmfap	Mac had a 10$ off a 50$ purchase about 6 weeks ago but other than that it seems to be a rare occurence that Mac itself has a sale. Mac has free shipping, though.	reddit-nadicee	ctjmwcr	Do stand alone Macs do the $10 for $50 thing or just ones inside stores?	reddit-Charlotteeee	ctjn8aj	I believe its only online.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	dkmywqj	happy birthday juice -----------------------  Hope you have an awesome birthday! The best birthday present I ever received was a surprise visit from my best friend who I hadnt seen in two years cause she moved to Wisconsin and Im in Arizona.	reddit-Torisuta	dko8rz4	That is so sweet of your friend!! How did she coordinate her trip and keep it a secret from you?	reddit-juicemagic	dkq47th	She had said that the weather there had been bad and sent me a picture of snow. Then a few minutes later, I got a knock on my door.
GamerGhazi	ctcbouj	Something something THE NARRATIVE IS CRACKING SJEWS	reddit-anem0ne	ctcbv2a	Um what?	reddit-Beneathejellyfishy	ctcbysu	There *is* no point to GGs invasions of hashtags other than to make themselves feel powerful by trying to silence yet another #NotYourShield group.  It makes them feel like theyre winning (i.e., cracking the sjw narrative) even though to *everyone else* they just look like choleric shitholes.

Also - If you could have any super power, what would you choose and why?	reddit-moxiousmissy	cspyy9c	GabeN -  <link>   Lazer vision, definitley	reddit-nkrlive	cspz1h5	Ooooo thank you for enlightening me :p  Lazer vision, eh? How come?  I used to say teleporting (for travel/sleep purposes), Ive since changed my mind to shape shifting because its hella cool and I could still accomplish my travels quickly to avoid rush hour bwahaha. 
changemyview	csstbfs	We are clearly reading different news sources, because that is not what Ive understood.  The children are getting the food.	reddit-Soviet_Russia321	csstfwq	If I remember correctly from South Korean and Japanese news sources, the children do get the food, but there still is an emphasis on feeding the army first. So the aid that countries send doesnt have as good an effect as it should.	reddit-jxz107	cssumxp	Fair enough, I suppose.  However, I still think that anything that helps feed starving children is our moral obligation as a world.
TrollXChromosomes	ct7pekm	Pick something in the dickpic to nitpick and make them insecure as fuck.	reddit-Anticept	ct7r55i	The thought of nitpicking a dickpick makes me laugh because it rhymes.  Also, this *might* actually stop them.  Probably not, but maybe.	reddit-SaveLakeCanton	ct7rggj	Thats their pride. Deflate it by pointing out something insignificant and make a huge deal of it, and it will eat them up. Brag about how you are going to show all the girls how hilariously bad the dickpic is. Psychology.  Hell. You dont even need to nitpick. Just be like Omg, whats wrong with your dick? Hahahhahaha. I have to totes show megan this! and they will form their own insecurities.
3Dprinting	d5rav4v	your bed isnt properly level.	reddit-Wachacha	d5rguge	Tell me more, is it too high? Is it to low to the bed? 	reddit-PREDATORJK	d5rhsqx	One side is too far away from the bed. Well, sort of... its more like one corner is far lower than it should be. But also, just generally, either your build platform may be warped or your rods might be bend(the rods thing is just a guess based on the lack of uniformity in the bottom layers and the patchy nature thereof)
entertainment	c0v6nip	Dexter cooks his ham on high, obviously. That whole opening is 30 seconds, tops.	reddit-BeJeezus	c0v89qe	But it comes out so pink and juicy, high would burn it and suck out the moisture.  :P	reddit-seemefearme	c0v9kje	Nah, you cook it on high so that you can cook it quick. Its slow cooking  that will dry it out. This is why you cook steaks hot and fast.
depression	c5cqf79	I am very sorry to hear that people have said that to you. Of course other people have problems. Heck, my DOG has problems, but that cant invalidate my feelings, or yours.  Its like when youre a kid and you wont eat something, and your parents tell you, There are starving children in ___! True, but my eating broiled spinach against my will wont change that. 	reddit-Feeling-Electric	c5cqk4x	I used to say, use my allowance to send it to them.	reddit-effeduphealer	c5cs57n	Jokingly or seriously? Either way, thats probably the best think Ive heard all day. 
yugioh	ciowiyn	FUCK MY FRIENDS FOR THINKING IM HYPER COMPETITIVE!! SPIDERS ARE A FUCKING CASUAL DECK YOU SCRUBS. IF YOU WANT TO WIN SPEND MORE THAN $5 DOLLARS ON A DECK! YOUR OJAMA/MILL/SHAPSNATCH OTK WILL NEVER BEAT ANYTHING!	reddit-EricBUdy	cip7r3k	I COULD NEVER FIND A SPIDER BUILD THAT WAS EVEN SEMI-COMPETITIVE. ITS A LITTLE HARD TO HAVE FUN WHEN EVEN THE MOST BASIC OF DECKS SHIT ON YOU. 	reddit-errorami	cipb31m	BUT THEY GET SO SALTY FROM LOSING, THEY LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO BUILD A DECK AMD GET PISSED THAT I DO.

yugioh	d5ezwza	Someone is playing Cyber Dragon.  In 2016.  And hes 6-1.	reddit-exaenae	d5fb7dc	I would like any and all information you could give me about this	reddit-dprue	d5fekvt	So that I dont try to remember things and probably fuck it up, go here and go to around the last hour (around 12 hours 25 minutes is where it starts).   Sadly he lost but its still quite impressive he managed to get 6-2 after 8 rounds.
socialism	d4vrgaw	Capitalism is dying. The question is, how bad we will let things get before we put it out of its misery and replace it? Are we going to try to prolong it slowly and painfully until maybe its too late or are we going to end it and replace it with a better system i.e. socialism	reddit-danknesslover02	d4vwtjo	I wouldnt go so far as to say its dying tbh.	reddit-Bronstedlowry1	d4vxw1h	Well its obvious that capitalism cant be sustained for much longer. It may not seem on the brink of collapse right now, but in the somewhat near future we will have to probably make a choice between capitalism or near universal suffering due to increased automation and climate change. Sorry if that sounds a little dramatic. 
OaklandAthletics	dkgel6y	Yankees fan here. I really feel for you. Expect 50 home runs though, because a lot of Yankees turn out to be amazing on other teams, i.e. Ivan Nova	reddit-NintuneJoe	dkgg7kk	We know Chris Carter well, we had him first....	reddit-AttemptedWit	dkggc7c	Obviously, just saying if he hits 50 home runs the rest of the season you heard it first here lol
hawks	cstvxe5	Trading Saad actually gave us a lot of flexibility. We can ice a team thats better than last years while being nearly 3m under the cap if we  trade Bickell and Versteeg.	reddit-Phridgey	cstwsep	Ive also had this thought.  Was in Chicago for a Cubs game yesterday (Iowa boy) and had to pass over some conversation I overheard about it from a couple meatheats and it was clear that they didnt give a fuck about who we got in return.	reddit-Tornsys	cstyts5	We can run this roster and still be 2.8m under the cap. That is a crazy nice roster.
minnesotaunited	ciyqcb1	One more thing, The amazing KJ designed these scarves again, and did an amazing job!	reddit-Billmk	cj1cwl5	Amazing job designing these. I love that KJ incorporated Cymraeg on the reverse side. Im United born; Im United bred; and when I die, Im United dead... but my ancestors were Welsh, so Ill be picking up one of these on Saturday.	reddit-Nhowlz	cj1f6jh	Yay!  That was the one piece that KJ kept from my otherwise rather pedestrian initial design.  Seriously, these are going to be very popular, make sure to get there early.

totalwar	cb2sbvi	Yup, crossed the Indus, but his men fearing even larger armies in the East, mutinied, and he complied by turning South and then back West.	reddit-Time_Terminal	cb31twq	Source on the reason being fear of large armies? I always thought it was a fear that he would march forever. I also remember solidifying the fermenting rebellions as a reason. His absence had made the conquered territories begin to rumble.	reddit-Blizzaldo	cb3bob0	Refer to pages 130-132
ethereum	dkpy2vm	This is why Hillary Clinton lost the election.  Calling green frogs racist because some idiots somewhere on some obscure forum said some bad things.  Absurdity.  You are reading fake news	reddit-Crypto_Economist42	dkq4k2t	I have never heard anyone calling NPR fake news before. To each his own!!!	reddit-rfikki	dkq7sg3	NPR is usually not fake news.  But in this case, it is.  This whole story is absurd.

I dont like McDonald so I dont eat there, but I dont think is appropriate for me to tell others what they can or cannot eat.	reddit-mydogjustdied	cb5qj4w	I think drawing a line between  a petition to stop a development and telling others what they can or cannot eat. is a bit thin?    	reddit-Evadregand	cb5qopb	Why?   I dont agree with a lot of things that are built in Melbourne like the casino so I dont go there.  I dont want it closed just because I dont like it, that would be selfish and would make Melbourne boring.  Maccas is no different, i choose not to eat that shit, its garbage pretending to be food.

And now he wants to show us what we missed out on. 	reddit-PhilDunphy_	ciwdmmz	We traded him because he wouldnt take the fucking offer. Kind of a slap in the face to the bulls by luol	reddit-buttholez69	ciwdner	That is also true.

Honestly I think both of us(me and ex) Are still a bit immature. And well. I dont really think its.... Unreasonable or at least surprising concerning our age. Yes. There are definitely times where I could have reacted better. Whenever I recognizes this I apologizes for them and make mental note for future problems and try to fix it. But... You can only fix the past to a certain degree. 	reddit-ura0124	cst2wlm	May I ask how old you two are?

ClashOfClans	ciox8q7	very interesting video so far (im 14 minutes into it right now) and I want to make a point on where i believe hes wrong. he says that supercell hasnt fixed ghosting yet, however ghosting was actually fixed in this update.	reddit-genecy	ciox9wl	Really? I wasnt aware of this, how did they exactly fix it?	reddit-Kerry_coc	cioxj8l	if you disconnect in a clan war attack, itll leave you with whatever you had up to that point. for example, if im attacking and get a 100% on the raid, but i lost connection in the middle of it, when i only had 38%, then the war log would show a 38%.
bleach	d5vf5o3	Are you only counting the times he shouted out **GETSUGA TENSHOU!**? What about the ones his kept inside his sword and the ones he used when possessed?  Sorry, its just that 30 GT + 3 special GT seems less than what I thought.	reddit-Arturo-Plateado	d5vfp4u	I counted any fired Getsuga Tenshous. The ones he kept in his sword dont count since he doesnt release them(he tends to do that any time he slashes really). Ive counted the times hes been possessed though. So 33 it is. The anime adds more Getsugas though.	reddit-KhaoticTwist	d5vfslq	Yeah, that makes sense. I guess the anime probably padded out some fights with a few GTs and there were a few in the filler arcs too.
beyondthebump	dkvzg4u	Why is your cousin in law telling you all of this? I wouldnt trust her with much. Theres a good chance she knows all of these conversations because she was in on them. 	reddit-gorksicle	dkw03su	She doesnt have any kids, but they are thinking about it soon. It all started because she was saying that if they were saying stuff like that about me she could only imagine what it will be like when she has kids. She is kind of the quiet by stander type. She said she would just roll her eyes at them. 	reddit-a2robbin	dkw0rwo	Ahh makes sense why she might tell you then.

I guess pregnancy brain isnt a myth.	reddit-snowsilk	d500yj0	I didnt look in stores though! Only online, as I shopped from abroad. You might have a good excuse :)

I didnt realize it was ever pressed but now I gotta find a copy!	reddit-Redditmrg	civh2er	This album is so different from their past albums but I love the direction they took with it. Have you heard their new album Stroll? Similar to this one, although imo fluent in stroll is better.   For some reason on Discogs some guys selling this album for a extremely high price, but check eBay. I saw it at a buy it now price of like 30 bucks a while ago. 	reddit-Miamasa	civz19s	Havent heard the new one yet Ill have to check it out. And glad you told me that was a high price haha- I saw that and just though well guess Im not getting that album

AndroidQuestions	d5jpz0o	Unless youre on 6.0, you cannot change the permissions that apps have.	reddit-u6z2	d5jr6zh	Is there a way to upgrade to 6.0 on the Note 4?  May sound like a stupid question, but I just did a factory reset and I thought that it would update my phone to the newest available version!   EDIT:  I see that it has not been released in the USA yet, but I can flash it on there myself.  If I flash the 6.0 on myself (not using the American version) will it be in a different language?  	reddit-MichaelEasy	d5jrnhj	Factory reset simply sets it back to how it first was when you initially turned it on. Who is your carrier?  As for the volume problem, did the app that you installed help at all?

Do you have any pics?	reddit-vorropohaiah	d5y4e5b	I actually went back to the black and white stage because I *hadnt* had it at a 2:1 proportion, so G. Projector was generating some distorted maps.   And this time around Im also spending more time on my height maps and rivers.  Ill have pictures soon though.
Plumbing	dkymom3	Its code for me provided that the AC is above the lav, and has to have an overflow drain visible from outside.  But yeah it should be tied in before the trap with the branch wye, so smells dont get up there as easy.	reddit-unknown1313	dkyugbl	Thanks, and yes the AC is above the lav and has another overflow going outside the house.   Im planning on running hose from the 3/4 condensate PVC to the branch tailpiece so the condensate comes in before the trap.	reddit-thinkinatoms	dkz27ye	Yep no problems with that and how it is commonly done here. I usually put a male adapter on the pvc then use 7/8 black rubber dishwasher hose. 
KotakuInAction	dk7z8lp	> The only problem I really had with this, is that more could of been done with Riley. Introducing her and then immediately killing her off is **just a waste of a character**  Unless you read the The Last of Us: American Dreams comic. I think its the prequel to Left Behind and The Last of Us	reddit-AL2009man	dk8ogjr	I would guess 99% of this thread heard about that comic for the first time in your post.	reddit-Intra_ag	dk8ukro	I afraid that youre correct.  I heard about the comic a few years back, but havent gotten the chance to read it.
AskAnAmerican	djuuoxu	Does the original dish have that butter BBQ sauce?   Im curious because I think New Orleans grabbed the dish and made it even more unhealthy. 	reddit-Bugseye	djv3pbc	BBQ sauce?  I only know of ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, or mustard based BBQ sauces.  Low Country shrimp and grits is based around butter and heavy cream.  Some people add paprika and a little hot sauce to give it a reddish hue, maybe thats what youre thinking of.  It doesnt taste like BBQ sauce though.	reddit-plethora-of-pinatas	djvb7k5	This is the dish Im talking about. I put BBQ in quotes because its not BBQ sauce, but thats what they call it. The sauce is butter based, so it sounds like the same thing. 
cinematography	djtzj2i	If its super on the move, and you dont need particularly harsh and directional light, a variable color LED will make your workflow a lot faster. Dont really need to worry about diffusion, gels, nets/scrims as much as a tungsten.	reddit-HarryHarrison45	dju1ns9	What would you recommend to replace? I dont think I have the budget to add it outright, unfortunately 	reddit-duhpolan	dju3dn7	It seems like the 2K and Source 4 are pretty intentional. Unless youre doing something specific for the Arri lights, I think that you can replace the Arris with a pair or just even one Litepanel or any 1x1. But I dont know the project or your intentions, so I cant really gauge on gear for it. Just my opinion, but it ultimately comes down to the look you want.

Where did you purchase the kit?	reddit-Fudgebucket55	d5eimu2	Greddy doesnt come with a tune, so youll need to get that done.  I got mine via Motoeast. Hes on the ft86 forums as Moto-Mike.

Pathfinder_RPG	ctkvfi0	You can, take Construct Rider and install an Internal Reservoir with an Enlarge Person or another size increasing extract, assuming your DM allows the effects to work on it.  Then you just take a similar extract and have Construct Armor go on.	reddit-Railgun5	ctkvmcf	Hm....well, if I cant pilot a gundam, piloting a Zoid is just as good. :)	reddit-CeciliaMiles	ctkvrcc	If youre wearing it as armor its not a Zoid, its more like a Power Rangers-style beast armor or something.

MechanicalKeyboards	csoqgfv	I know this might be outside of your budget, but you can always get a TKL aluminum case thats low profile. That will make all of your keys floating. You can get one of them on mechanicalkeyboards.com (assuming theyre in stock) for under $150. But if youre about to buy a new keyboard AND get the new case, youre looking at much more than $150.	reddit-NoseKnowsAll	csoqniw	I think I saw something about the low profile cases - looking at this post, it looks like the PCB is left exposed in several places (see this picture specifically). I would worry about dust getting in.	reddit-funks	csoqyej	It depends on how your keyboard is set up. The PCB might not be open to the environment. Look at your keyboard and see if thats the case.

Brawlhalla	d59zbw1	second one is close program dont worry, that was a joke not a real problem in my pc ;b 	reddit-Kotzuo	d59zydl	Yeah i noticed it was the joke, but did it really say close program or open like i said?	reddit-Orion_God	d5b7wo8	Second one is Close program
hardstyle	dkjx2h5	haha definitely see plenty of people in europe still dancing like that   personally much more of a fan of the smooth euro style that has developed over the last 10 years	reddit-optmspotts	dkk6brf	Do you have examples?	reddit-swagpresident1337	dkk6u32	<link>    <link>    <link> 
LiverpoolFC	ciwy6sn	Baffling is correct. Sorry but anyone who thought these rumours were anything other than utter nonsense is either delusional or just doesnt know enough about football.   0% Chance.	reddit-Chazwatti	ciwy897	Exactly. We are *far* too pre-occupied with buying Southampton players to even look at anyone else. Jay fucking Rodriguez is the latest Ive seen.	reddit-IRONic__MAN	ciwy8py	If not for his injury and the fact Southampton will be very reluctant to sell him, I think Jay Rodriguez would be a very good signing.  
LAlist	d58y3rt	The better move would be to let someone sign you into their device and walk for you. Sign out when done. Have a few devices and rush hour traffic = money. 	reddit-joshuaherman	d58y6eb	I do live stream games on Twitch so I already have experience playing for other people!	reddit-justgentile	d58yilh	Nice. You could charge $1 per kilometer with several devices at once. 
TF2fashionadvice	cb1p3gy	What does the kringle look like with the new coat you have equipped?	reddit-BEEFJAKE	cb1rtl1	They clip together, so you cant equip them. Sorry :c	reddit-Thornpath	cb1swjn	Yes you can.  Step 1) go to a blank loadou  Step 2) choose all miscs and hats you want  Step 3) reconnect internet  When you reconnect it will force all selected items ob.
climbing	c58m2z0	I have wide feet, not especially huge, but I have trouble finding shoes that I can both get into, and touch the end with sufficient pressure. The best shoes that I have found are Rock Pillar Pearls. I find them to be  insanely confortable, even when a tight fit. Im in New Zealand and  got them sent directly from Czech.   <link> 	reddit-heilvetica	c58nz7q	Those look like great shoes and i like the styling, and appropriate amount of aggressive curve. How is the sizing on them? I wear Scarpa Vapors for reference if you know the shoe. 	reddit-doublebullshit	c58ph9o	I think I went a half size down from street shoes. I will check when I get home.
financialindependence	d51dw29	I see youve never researched nursing homes.   I kid. Kinda.	reddit-MoneyMitten	d51g4wq	Im sure not everyone feels this way, but... I plan to end my life accidentally on some crazy adventure once Im at the point where Id begin to burden my family with nursing homes. I kid... but only kinda.	reddit-tloznerdo	d51gn69	I get it. I also have let all family members know I DO NOT want my life extended unnecessarily. My husband and I joke that if we get a hangnail--just pull the plug.   On a more serious note, Brittany Maynard. :( Given the choice, Id do it her way.
Minecraft	ciq20ip	Did anyone read the full tweet? Notch didnt say Herobrine is real.   He said  > Fine, Herobrine is real, and he gains spooky vengeance haunting power whenever you remind me of him. Only way to stop him is to ignore him.	reddit-sndzag1	ciq3x3u	Yes he fucking did!   > Fine, **Herobrine is real**, and he gains spooky vengeance haunting power whenever you remind me of him. Only way to stop him is to ignore him.	reddit-Tim337	ciq49vk	Except um, the beginning and end of all that makes it very clear its a joke about you guys not shutting up to him about Herobrine.   Context matters, silly.
OrthodoxChristianity	c5bcbvw	Alright. Im not very familiar with Orthodoxy, so could I ask where the idea of Mary as the Ark comes from? 	reddit-kidnappster	c5cszdw	It has to do with the parallels of the story of Mary (Luke 1) and 2 Samuel 6	reddit-mennonitedilemma	c5ctbfd	I will look into that, thank you!
hardstyle	ct7a1vf	Its not from cheating, I believe it was for COD MW2. Just some kind of exploit which a lot of people got banned for. (C9 Swag for example has the same VAC ban.) He was very good at the early COD games and I know he played competitively for awhile when he was a lot younger.  Source: I used to be part of Atmozfears 2008-2013 and have known Tim a long time and remember when this happened.	reddit-destrukto_	ct7c71e	Hey Kevin, is that you?  If so, the mods should get you special flair like other producers on here have. 	reddit-zman0728	ct7drj9	Yes it is me :) Sure that would be cool! I only recently started browsing this subreddit!
crochet	cb2t3lk	Those look great!  What yarn (and weight) did you use for them?  Ive been looking to get into more intricate pieces but I dont know enough about the best yarn for it.	reddit-Hybyscus	cb2t9hr	The yarn that I am using here is actually one of the very first ones I started using in fingering weight. This yarn is called Hempathy and is a cotton, hemp, modal blend. Its very versatile for summer lightweight projects.	reddit-mmorris720	cb2tcnf	Thanks!  I wasnt sure if I would need yarn lighter than sport to make a dress for my SO.  Ill look into that yarn since this dress is definitely meant for warm seasons.
TrumpCriticizesTrump	dk3h98o	Dont read the comments on YouTube unless you want brain aids.  Source: I read them.  Please kill me.	reddit-Reygle	dk3jlw5	I now wonder if half of these commenters are Russian trolls	reddit-blowhardV2	dk3k4te	Oh god I said *dont* read them. :/  Im sorry.
homegym	ct0mp3t	If that splits, youre in a world of pain.  I built mine out of wood and steel pipe. 	reddit-econkling	ct0ofjo	did you use wood for the stand-up supports and pipes for the crossbars? That seems like a pretty sturdy design.	reddit-batardo	ct0pn1g	Exactly. 
depression	d5olle0	take some anxiety meds, i also have problems turning off my brain. life would be so simple if i could just have a clear mind and shut off whoever the fuck is causing a ruckus in my brain	reddit-artistWbrokenfingers	d5olmnx	So do I just go to the doctor and tell him I have problems? What do you take or recommend?	reddit-yesiamheman	d5olrvg	the best drug ive taken so far is lyrica, its for nerve pain and fibromyalgia but anxiety is an off-label treatment.   my experience with SSRIs is that they are not good for helping the rambling anxiety/stfu the voice inside type of anxiety, but good for the type of anxiety where you are in physical pain because you are so nervous or tense
Anarchism	djpq9lx	nah from other stuff Ive seen he seems more like some kind of right wing libertarian. Criticizes government but has no problem with corporate interests stomping all over your privacy.	reddit-chipsngravy1	djprfjt	Can I see some examples of this? I remember he supported BLM a while ago. 	reddit-TheFesterinThespian	djq3zw4	votes for ron paul  thinks corporations should be allowed to survail you as long as its for business purposes
askgaybros	dkwikx6	Mate this is sad. Its just some guy on some subreddit, cool your jets.	reddit-OldManDubya	dkwimx9	Is this sad to hold your own opinion? Or is it sad, because its controversial?	reddit-dogjxsopd	dkwitqk	I suppose I would just never think to question why some person on Reddit gets a lot of attention. Why does it matter?
Madden	dkn06lp	If you Super Sim it doesnt matter. Super Sim is just a roll of the dice. There is a YT video in which someone compares how a player plays with various attributes (incl. AWR) at 0 or 99. I dont remember the results though.  	reddit-Berlin_Blues	dkn1mle	But doing a normal sim without entering the game relies on awareness and other stats?	reddit-brunskie12	dkn2g1n	Stats definitely matter in that case. I am not sure how much of a difference AWR makes. I did see an improvement with my HB after bumpung his AWR from 40 to 80. But it wasnt significant and my last season he wasnt spinning and juking as much as in the season when I raised his AWR.   As far as my QB goes, his AWR didnt seem to matter. He threw loads of INTs until I raised his accuracy.  
fantasybaseball	djq0g98	Nelson Cruz DTD or Clint Fraizer for the week?	reddit-cruz-campo	djq1tv2	Im in same boat. Might toss Frazier in for Garcia instead.	reddit-Mplisko	djq2htl	Put in Fraizer. Thinking is that if its a knee thing, and with the upcoming ASG, Ms may play it safe and keep him out and give him almost 10-days rest without putting him on DL.
NASCAR	d5w0fms	Road Americas pretty nasty too. Three very long, fast sections all leading to some of the sharpest turns seen on a NASCAR road course (1, 5, and Canada Corner), plus the Carousel and the Kink.	reddit-Yoshiman400	d5w0t0q	Didnt Kurt Busch have a brake problem testing out there and rail an ambulance in the run-off for turn 5?	reddit-dj10show	d5w0v07	I dont know, I cant remember any story like that offhand. Given the track and the cars though I wouldnt be surprised.
philadelphia	ct3c6z7	You really dont get what he was saying at all do you? He was saying that, in the best interest of his clients, going to trial wouldnt be preferable because someone on the jury may be gay and that would obviously bias them against the defendants.   Hes not making a value judgement about homosexuals you fucking moron.	reddit-TrollAccount420	ct45vgq	Yes he is. Does he not think straight people are biased FOR the defendants? Then he shouldnt think the opposite of gays on the jury.	reddit-FuchsiaGauge	ct47ky3	It must be really interesting being you.
halo	d5n8jfd	Im really getting kinda disgusted at this perpetual fucking circlejerk. Its fucking eternal. 	reddit-BLUYear	d5nbohe	I completely agree with the OP about the armor, but it does go on and on. It never bothers me and I usually ignore it, but its always a trigger for a bunch of arguments and such. 	reddit-TangyBrownCiderTown	d5nd3uz	At the end of the day, I dont care. Like, Im fine with the armor and shit, I enjoy the overall art direction and can concede that some elements are over done. But man, this shit just doesnt stop. 
MMORPG	d4y9n84	I just recently got into Albion and it is actually really refreshing and unique to me. The open world pvp combined with an in depth crafting and gathering system, GVG, Difficult dungeons, classless system, player ran cities and AH, no questing, along with personal/guild islands is really unique feeling. I love it and would definitely consider the game if I were you!	reddit-theRee1Dea1	d4ya1ba	Can I only currently play it if I buy a founders pack?	reddit-Hellthrower	d4yao6t	Yep. Its in closed beta ATM with release coming later this year. There will be character wipes before and at release though, so I would not get too invested.
ApplyingToCollege	d5l6rus	Yeah, my 610 Math II just wont do as a matter of my own pride	reddit-fight4lifee	d5l7kn3	I feel the same way about my 710 Math and 630 Bio. I know that I can do better haha, either way youve still got a good score! 	reddit-CheckMyBrain11	d5l9eu5	Literally same boat, 730 Bio 610 Math hahaha
TheRedPill	djoinot	Worth billions and hes the democratically elected leader of the United States.   You must be new here. 	reddit-Coolnick154	djpu54u	a fucking baboon, you guys put on a pedestal.    maybe you were here too long. maybe you should go back to putting women on pedestals again instead of guys? or, by chance, are you gay and secretly in love with the orange?	reddit-Golderoy_Lickhart	djq3i6p	He put himself on the pedestal by becoming the most powerful person on the planet.   Why are you so triggered?
Spiderman	cj8vyp8	I definetly agree. 	reddit-jjaaccoobb33	cj8vyv5	I see you used definetly in your post.

GirlGamers	d54rhi7	I cant wait to start streaming as well. The community of Twitch is really nice and I love it! Its really nice to see the positive energy that streaming is giving you <3	reddit-GrumpyLadyNinjaCat	d54rmq9	Its not very positive in a lot of female streams, but I think they invite a certain type of sexual attention that I do not want from the Internet 	reddit-khaljiit	d54s0xk	Its because you have a lot of female streamer on Twitch whos not there for the gaming. They wear sexy outfit to have a big audience and make money. I dont like that. Nothing against that but its just not the right website to do that... 
LawSchool	ct00u43	1) Most people dont stay in Biglaw for more than a few years, and   2) If you think only Biglawyers have to work 70 hours a week, youre in for a big surprise 	reddit-anti09	ct03fps	That second point is not true everywhere. It seems to be in the areas that are heavily saturated. 	reddit-Squeezymypenisy	ct04msh	I never said *all* lawyers have to work 70 hours a week, but rather that working 70 hours a week isnt found *exclusively* in Biglaw.  So unless youre arguing that there are certain regions in which *no* lawyer works 70 hours a week, my statement holds.
mycology	cb3wzlt	It seems that they were stuck between Clavulina amethystina, Ramaria versatalis, and Ramaria purpurissima. I always have problems getting my camera to focus on what I want it to focus on too.	reddit-CBDemon	cb3x3m5	I thought they nailed it down due to geography? Seems C. amethystina is closest, but Ive not much experience with these.	reddit-Spitinthacoola	cb3x673	Yeah I think they did rule the others out due to the fact they have never been recorded to grow in Florida.  Ive never had the pleasure of seeing these in real life, so I dont have experience with them either.
Drama	dk061gr	How new are you? Oxus was a serial shitposter well before he started doing it for free at SRD.	reddit-SithisTheDreadFather	dk0kcjn	> redditor for 10 days	reddit-TSA_Precheck	dk0l7ij	Aww fuck. I forgot to trawl your history looking for things to implicate you. Uhhh..... Airforce, eh? I knew youd be some pigdog imperialist slave. How many babies did u murder????   
ChapoTrapHouse	dkas7jr	A lot of the antizionist left buys into the same conspiracy theories (Rothschilds owning all central banks, Zionists owning all of America/the West, Zionists being behind ISIS/Al Qaeda/all terror attacks, replacing the wanton nazi usage of Jewish press with Zionist press when it comes to blaming any media) as the far right. 	reddit-cimarafa	dkaujmc	Lol fail	reddit-joboettiger	dkawj12	Youve really never seen people talking about the Rothschilds on the left? 
Drugs	cj8km2s	Most likely a random cathinone or diluted methamphetamine.  > definitely cocaine in it as it numbed my mouth when I rubbed it on my gums  That doesnt mean anything, easily just lidocaine	reddit-FuckYeahDrugs	cj8ktdp	Cool.  As long as youre relatively sure its not MDMA.  Im not going to grip from him again then.	reddit-whattheheckman12	cj8l1t3	If it was MDMA, he would have sold it as MDMA- shit is more expensive than blow.
startrek	d5meslh	I liked her, I dunno if Id want her on the enterprise but Id certainly be happy to see her again. The integration of Carol in STID feels jarring / awkward in comparison. They might have made her seem a bit too good at everything but I guess you could argue that being stranded in that place forced her to really push herself.	reddit-The_Brown_Widow	d5mez3w	She was honestly getting her ass handed to her by Kralls lieutenant.  Shes effective, to be sure, but not Wonder Woman.	reddit-BrainWav	d5mftt3	true, but she fought back pretty hard. Im not sure Montgomery Scotty could take on a guy like that + he **was** taunting her about killing her father+ she **did** get away from him to safety, so id call that a win.  Edit: Im not trying to be critical, I did like her. [also typos]

I will be kicking inactive people from time to time 	reddit-JamBug	d5hqakr	Can you send me invite? Username is Jason Cortez with 4.2m earnings rank 31	reddit-MrZetroc	d5hx2qi	Invite sent  Were in the top 3,000 now. Hoping for top 1,000!
bicycling	ct6a8ov	Nice bike, in the future shoot with the light source behind you to avoid the white out from the lights glare :-)	reddit-mattdahack	ct6ae71	Gotcha! I got it from bikesdirect and then assembled it myself. Its my first bike since at least 8 years, last time I had one I was literally 7 years old.	reddit-codedapple	ct6aoze	Thats awesome man, great job. I have a Giant Sedona xl hybrid that I love. Great bike :-)
Multicopter	dkd5j7s	Is it worth upgrading older ESCs to a newer generation? Im using a TBS Powercube and noticed theyve released a V2 version, but Im having trouble figuring out exactly whats the improvement is (TBS say more powerful and faster reaction). Is it likely to be a worthwhile upgrade or just something I should swap to if the old ones die?	reddit-black42x	dkd5qkp	I would wait. If the ones you have are working fine(i.e. not on fire or dropping out), I would save or put the money towards something else.	reddit-Easy_senpai	dkdhznl	Thanks for the info!
againstmensrights	cb0kht0	>Real men dont have issues.  The fuck are you doing in mens rights movement then?  Oh right, hating women and forming a misogynistic circlejerk.  Carry on.	reddit-SifSekhmet	cb0om6j	It was Reverend Rick on the forum theyre whining about who said that, not one of the misters.	reddit-KTKitten	cb0yrcw	Well thats just terrible then.
food	ciu5ljs	I almost gagged looking at that. Tell me this isnt normal in America?	reddit-Spacegod87	ciu61oz	It isnt. I think we as Muricans take an almost perverse joy in devising new and exciting ways to horrify each other. The problem being is this happened to be *delicious.* But, having sampled its dark pleasures, will my soul ever be clean?	reddit-ctwelve	ciu647x	Yea, but is it the *pinnacle* of deliciousness? If not, there is still hope for you.
nrl	d5i0qn9	I can confirm that I was absolutely brushed by him, but Im not about to 100% confirm that it was a racial thing. I just reckon hes a cunt. 	reddit-deesmutts88	d5i3idu	So what though? Aboriginal kids do it hard, Id totally make more of an effort for those guys than I would a white kid who calls me an unfit lazy fat cunt behind my back (i.e me)	reddit-SurfKing69	d5i3n1s	I said My name is Daniel. He said You know my name. White, black, purple, reptilian. I dont give a fuck. Those are the words of a cunt. 
TwoBestFriendsPlay	ct4kcoc	Neat - I guess since they didnt write Final theyre going to have another video where they mess around with the new commands to find more stuff.	reddit-Norix596	ct515ci	Woolie said it was only going to be a 4 part series. Unless him or Matt really wanted to go back and dig up some other stuff, I kinda doubt well get another.	reddit-Chronis67	ct516zz	Hmm, guess they just forgot to write final on it then.
FFRecordKeeper	ctdbubh	I think this is one of the few PSAs that is, in fact, actually a PSA that People Should Know About.  So thank you for that!	reddit-themattybee	ctdkml9	PSA: PSA stands for Public Service Announcement	reddit-cowvin2	ctdnysh	I am aware of what it means.   I was Capitalizing For Emphasis. I just happened to pick words with inconvenient starting letters.

Your backlogged mangas are the best ones ;_;	reddit-tjbice	dkc6dsj	Which ones	reddit-nitorita	dkcarb3	<Darwins Game> <Adu of Hades> & <Rengoku Deadroll>. But, Im just happy theyre being translated at all (minus Rengoku for now?) Id be sad if any of the three were dropped lol. 
linux	d5rasea	Actually, here in the Netherlands Jan Janssen is a combination of a very common first name and a very common surname. Not cruel, just traditional I guess. 	reddit-gsmo	d5tzvyo	Yes, I know, but its sort of a joke placeholder name typically used to mean the plainest most unremarkable person you can think of	reddit-we_are_systemd	d5u46j3	...whoosh....
AskWomen	caux764	/r/asianladyboners, /r/makeupaddiction, /r/bigboobproblems (less guilty pleasure and more support group) and any food related subreddit. I love to cook and get ideas. 	reddit-grandteton	cavq5no	Is the third subreddit in any way related to your username or is that just a coincidence?	reddit-misplaced_my_pants	cavq6bs	I didnt create that subreddit,  but my username is in reference to having large breasts. Yes. 
killingfloor	d5egqlx	If you want a action rpg fps there are games like Destiny, The Division and Borderlands to scratch that itch. As a gamer with limited time i personally love the aspect of Killing Floor being a quick fix were you jump in and play a couple of matches of visceral horde action without thinking about any end game.	reddit-Tripsix_Swe	d5emh06	Thanks.  I know about all these others games.   I was asking about KF and how people approach it.   That is all.	reddit-McFickleDish	d5ex8rk	Its good that i gave you my approach then. In my opinion KF does not need to more than a fun pick up and play horde game with a simple perk/class leveling system. I was not trying to be passive aggressive. Im just pointing out that there are other sources to get a more complete action rpg package if thats what you are lookning for.
masseffect	ct7vesa	-  Mass Effect 1:   <link>  -  Mass Effect 2:  <link>  -  Mass Effect 3:   <link> 	reddit-izmirtheastarach	ct7vnmc	Thanks. Would you say from personal experience that casual and normal are somewhat the same or different?	reddit-mkvamm	ct7w4id	Im sure I must have played ME1 on Normal years ago, but Ive never played ME2 or ME3 on anything other than Insanity. The wiki info is about as detailed as you can get, though.
australia	cazjxlz	Can we just add:  Stephen Koukoulas is a Research Fellow at Per Capita, a progressive think tank.  Between October 2010 and July 2011, he was economic policy advisor to the Prime Minister Julia Gillard.	reddit-rezplzk	cazkfzd	A potential for conflict is not proof of conflict.  Is anything incorrect, misleading or biased with what he actually wrote? 	reddit-dlg	cazkipw	He presented one side of the argument/debate.  Try to honestly read it with a neutral view point (mind you its quite difficult for me).  Only presented facts that favoured his opinion/belief.  I am sure we could find a Coalition writer to find many different facts/figures to evaluate the governments performance in a different light. 
cincinnati	cb16fjb	Not sure how many people you can support but if you really want more you should posting about this on Planet LAN Its facebook page and their League of Legends division page. Id say Ill be there but a lot of us are going to Video Games Live this weekend. Good luck!  EDIT: If you are capable of supporting 32+ people please PM me, we are looking for venues to host future lans in Cincinnati.	reddit-oZEPPELINo	cb16qq3	Lol my house would never hold 32	reddit-soothaa	cb16ubb	Haha, no worries just checking. We are always on the looking for places that can hold a large LAN. We had ones with up to 40 people when Roxx was still around and it was only 40 because of size limitations. But now that theyre gone, its tough finding good LAN venues; toughest thing is power.    
overlanding	dkm40uz	Yea, with campsites, I could easily store it in the bear proof container, or walk to the nearest garbage bin which made it quite simple. Now that im going overlanding in remote areas, its impossible, unless I drive down to the nearest town or garbage bin after eating which is a bit ridiculous. 	reddit-Herrowgayboi	dkmht6v	The Yeti Tundra and Roadie coolers are grizzly bear rated. Ive heard of a few people locking all of their stuff in their yeti and stashing it away from their car. Always seemed like a good easy solution.	reddit-ashdhan	dkn1a8e	The only problem is that they cost a pretty penny.. Something im really not willing to front with just yet as I dont go overlanding often enough to justify the cost..  
WaltDisneyWorld	ctkouds	If you can make it over to the Polynesian, Trader Sams is a fun bar with sweeter drinks. The specialty drinks all have their own special effect in the bar. The downside is it fills up fast.	reddit-recklessconsumption	ctkov5j	Were actually staying there the first night of the trip!	reddit-dylanswitch	ctkp8kr	They have really awesome souvenir glasses. The bigger drinks can be pricey but are meant for more people (Punch Bowl, Nautilus). My favorite glass was the Volcanic themed Tiki one.

I went out and paid for canvases, paint, and the plastic I use to make stencils, then spent a good hour or more making each one of these. My only intention is to *GIVE THEM* to other fans of the show. The fact that you called me a thief is well... stupid. 	reddit-Mutki	c256f8a	Well I apologize.  I feel silly now.	reddit-An_Emo_Dinosaur	c256h6n	Well maybe try not calling me a thief or attempting to call me out. This is definitely not the place to do it, and if you do have any issues with me or what I do, feel free to send me a message or email. I will happily respond to you and resolve whatever problem you have.  Edit: May I offer you a bag of dicks?
steroids	dkt331b	Just came off my blast: 16 weeks test-e with some anadrol inbetween, i want to bridge and blast again 8 weeks later to build some mass: test+deca ( maybe d-bol inbetween which would me my personal choice ) However, here comes the clue. He wants me to bridge on 8 weeks of primo 200ml only. What do you guys think about this protocol? 	reddit-dutchgainster	dkt4d8f	Theres no steroid you stay on in cruises or bridges with by itself, except test.  Not primo, not EQ, not deca, etc.  Test only.	reddit-sgtcobblepot	dku6p94	Was thinking the same too, thanks for the input

Planetside	csxolc8	As someone not very familiar with rainmeter, do most of you use it on a second monitor while you run the game on your main?  Or just want the Vanu flair when not playing?	reddit-Kelbesq	csxps2n	I use it for the flair while not playing. I suppose you could run it dual-screen while playing if you wanted to.	reddit-VSDeggy	csxtl5b	Does it by default mimic your setup on multiple monitors?  or is it configurable enough for that to not be an issue?  One of my gripes so far with windows 10 is that while you can clone the task bar to all desktops, you cant clone the clock/systray out of the box without mods.......   
fatpeoplestories	cillgtt	As a vet I now want to punch him in his fat head.  As they say if you want to be Airborne you have to be thin  >making up some bullshit about killing infidels and ragheads and whatnot  He doesnt know what hes talking about if this is accurate. I only talk that way when Im really drunk and asked....maybe....	reddit-overtime_vulture	cilmrly	an arctic service ribbon,thats awesome.	reddit-monkeypunch13	cim7gs8	I wanted one of those assignments due (supposedly) 1 year equaling 2 or 3 in your enlistment.
techsupport	c5f15xt	The continuous updates and broken extensions turned me away from Firefox, completely. 	reddit-BlackBoxMindControl	c5f4wwb	I havent had an extension broken in a while, and I update my computer on a daily basis, so its never been an issue for me.  If you dont want to deal with Firefoxs updates, or Chromes spying, use Chromium.  All the perks of Chrome, and none of the spying.	reddit-Redard	c5f5080	Personally, I have no issue with Google collecting any data off me. *GASP* I mainly opt into anything that collects data, I have nothing to hide or any issues with people seeing what I browse or do, I dont do anything illegal, so no biggie for me, although everyone else feels that all their rights and everything private about them is leaked to the world. Oh well. 
HVAC	dkr7bdi	If TIGHT budget then you need to be looking at selling the house, not pouring more money into it.  A 75 year old in a McMansion is a disaster in the making.	reddit-AStuf	dkr80t5	Thanks for your sage advise. If we were looking to sell I woulda posted on a real estate sub, right?	reddit-1dundundun	dkrfrj9	I didnt think that you were looking to sell.  You should be.
skyrim	cawl5q3	One tip: if you like archery, when you do Faendal and Svens side quest, help Faendal and fuck up Sven. The elf becomes a follower and gives free archery training 	reddit-BatmanHimself	cawsiuq	whys free in quotations?	reddit-TheTiredLion	cawsqfx	Even though you can take your money back from his inventory, you still need to have it . If it was completely free, you would get some even having not a single penny :p
IAmA	d5k69u4	What about Poussey? :(	reddit-jacobjacobb	d5k7nq6	LALALALALALA SPOILERS I CANT HEAR YOU  (I havent seen the last few episodes of OITNB yet lol)	reddit-Atthevoltain	d5k95gn	Dude happy cake day!! And shhh dont ruin it!! Most people who havent seen it wont get it!! 
rocketbeans	dkkgqsz	Ganz unrecht hast du nicht. Simon meinte neulich in einem AD auch dass es ein Zeitpunkt gibt wo man mit den Ideen ausgeschossen ist und alles schon mal gemacht hat was man im kopf hat. Hat er sich auf die momentane Situation bei RBTV bezogen? Wäre ein schlechtes Zeichen.	reddit-hybrisssS	dkkqilk	Gings dabei nicht um Sketche bei Game One?	reddit-SgtJora	dkksmzk	Vordergründig schon. Hatte aber das Gefühl dass dies auch ein wenig für die ehemalige Spielwiese RBTV galt
Minecraft	c22xw01	If you are on peaceful you need to change to Easy/Normal/Hard for them to spawn.  They dont spawn right away and I think they follow the same rules as other mobs.  Youll need to be at least 30+ block away from their spawn area.	reddit-hypnotizd	c22xwrq	Difficulty is set to Normal.    Ill double check how far away Im stationed.    As I said, Ive been sitting here letting minecraft run since this morning, does it dake *that* long?    NINJA EDIT: I am *exactly* 32 blocks away from the closest spawn area I created (the others are farther).	reddit-raintheory	c22xx2b	It can.  I get slimes spawning in my main mineshaft at bedrock level.  Sometimes theyll spawn right away, sometimes I wont see them for a couple of hours.
fireemblemcasual	ctdw29h	My day was... meh. Just stayed indoors except to get fish and chips. Didnt play as many games as I mightve liked. Just surfed the net and browsed dank memes.	reddit-SilentMasterOfWinds	ctdwd7p	How dank were the memes?	reddit-Ark_Inek	ctdwquw	Approximately 420 on the dank-ometer.
thedivision	d5eg90c	I wouldnt bother with the full set. The 4th gear set bonus (the striker talent) is rather weak. It takes a while to build up the bonus even with an accurate, high rate of fire SMG.  3 piece striker with another gear set combo is good.	reddit-KodieCollings	d5eotdx	its best with shotguns.  I dont even both the SMG unless we are running lexington or certain parts of the UG where we can stun lock.  	reddit-_Zuckuss_	d5epcny	Why would you use a shotgun with Striker?  Sentrys Mark with the shotgun is the best combination in the game.
Sneakers	dktcrz7	Laces like that make the uncaged look so much better, now I want them	reddit-1112e	dktlcj9	So true. My whole problem with the uncaged is that it seems like somethings missing	reddit-j_man35	dktsh68	Would look so much better without the sock collar
UnresolvedMysteries	dki1awu	It would be an interesting exercise to pretend Burke didnt exist and look at the crime without him. 	reddit-biancaw	dkjs5e7	What an insightful post.  Agree 100 percent.  Rather than blame a 9 year old child, lets find the real killer.	reddit-contikipaul	dkkjji2	Dont get me wrong. Im generally in the Burke did it camp. But thinking outside the box never hurt anyone. If we take him out of the equation, what new insights might we come up with? 
DCComicsLegendsGame	djt5bqs	For a small sample size of 3 battles (I know... Low energy...), It seemed to trigger all three times... But as I said, a small sample size... Well check more later...	reddit-nikhcomicfan	djt6i7p	the bug is it triggering goddess of war instead of basic attack, did that happen?	reddit-RealAbd121	djtcve2	Nope not occurring...I thought the bug was 100% chance to proc basic for just one legendary pt
dirtgame	d5ow1or	Nice one, but am I the only one who doesnt exactly like Monaco?	reddit-krzo69	d5p205g	I love it. The tight turns, the hairpins, only thing missing are jumps. And those usually end up in a totaled car lol.	reddit-xcyte_x	d5p25wx	Yea I saw your video... Damn you rock that track xd
duolingo	cb7fzz2	I cant comment on French, but as a student of another Romantic (Brazilian Portuguese), I can say I have the same issue in my target language. I have to slow things down, and like a previous poster stated I also search for other identifiers. My apologies for a not so helpful reply. 	reddit-baleia_azul	cb7htfp	I speak Brazilian Portuguese and I have to tell you that the voice on duo lingo is horrible. Its so robotic sounding and unnatural that its hard for me to understand at times. Dont feel bad.	reddit-DogPencil	cb7jpuu	Thats fantastic to know! There are very few Portuguese speakers in my area, so its difficult to hear actual language being spoken.
Buffalo	cb5snsx	Per Buffalo News:   >Rodriguez is known by just 36 percent of Democratic voters. Nineteen percent have a favorable opinion of him, and 17 percent do not.  I know youre a Republican, but to be Mayor of Buffalo you need some Democratic votes. What is your strategy for reaching Democrats, and why are you polling around 50/50 among them now?	reddit-nemoomen	cb60fdi	This democrat likes him because he is forward thinking. 	reddit-sunnydelish	cb62vg8	What does that mean?
TryingForABaby	cizhrae	I reckon at 14 DPO its fine test at any time of the day, try to hold it for 2-3 hours though, lots of liquid drinking can make the results shady. GL	reddit-LuceenJo	cizogmt	Dont hold your urine. Once it reaches the bladder its as concentrated as it will get. No amount of holding it is going to make it more concentrated. 	reddit-chope1394	cizpgnb	so its another ttc myth? there are so many of them *sighs

WorldofTanks	d55a9o2	You might be awful if you think the e5 is OP. Its a good tank, not an OP tank - epically since the hd update to the armor. But that doesnt mean it  cant be penetrated by any player withe the correct number of chromosomes.	reddit-Top_Quack	d55h343	Love how all the shitlords come out and try and defend it. Clearly a tank that players in FAME say is OP is the opposite.	reddit-I_am_Polish	d55mf9m	FAME can have retarded opinions just like everyone else.

If youre a fan of the genre, you may also like Our Little Secret, by Roz Nay. SO GOOD.  (actually /u/cryptic-fox you may like that book too)	reddit-lunalannister	dkul8k8	Thanks! Ill take a gander!

And sucks ya had to sell your stuff. Hard to play without guns and whatnot	reddit-Mobob214	cinc3aw	yep, know what you mean.  Got rather frustrated with the guy I sold em to too.  He tore down my thunder maul for parts to replace a shitty cyma
Bad_Cop_No_Donut	cb2g6rp	I hate it when cops act like bullies so please dont misunderstand, but I notice your username is one that might raise the hackles of a cop i.e. DevilWorshipper.   Of course, the cop didnt know your username, but might there be something about your person or demeanor that you may have overlooked that a suspicious authoritarian person might key on?	reddit-tinwiskers	cb2mfqi	As I said, Im the most average looking middle-age white man you could ever imagine. 	reddit-DevilWorshipper	cb2mo46	I understand DevilWorshipper. Bully cops are unpleasant and dangerous. It sucks that we are seeing more and more of that kind of behavior.

photography	cj10r88	Buy a domain. Install Wordpress. Invest in a responsive design at ThemeForest. Wordpress themes are cheap, and in most cases you can customize them a lot! You wont regret your decision. 	reddit-strangedane	cj11sdh	I understand the craze behind Wordpress, really. I have a development environment for tinkering around in it. My desktop site is also mostly done, and Im working on it to also be a better programmer and designer. Im more so looking for UX input, on whether people have a specific full-screen plugin they use, whether you prefer pop open photos/pinch to zoom stuff, etc. 	reddit-lifeisac0medy	cj1n1z0	Oh, alright. I really dont possess the passion for programming. It could be funny to learn though. Anyways, I wish you success in this. 
bravefrontier	cj49s4o	typing will be irrelevant once imps are introduced in global.	reddit-Pluet	cj49ut2	i hope sometime down the road they will allow us some way to change the type via some form of quest evolve method. Heck ill even pay gems just to  randomize the typing.	reddit-Anthian	cj4a32r	imps basically remove typings. it would be irrelevant to gumi to introduce a way to change types if imps basically make them non-existant.

Hey, at least jimmy will kill the set break.	reddit-arhombus	d5nb9uv	While I dont necessarily see it as you do, I dont think you should be downvoted. 	reddit-cypressdwd	d5nbaz1	Its cool, I dont really care lol.  If its boring to me, its boring. Other peeps are free to like it. I hope they bring it for the second set.
Silverbugs	cipdmko	Exactly! I dont want to make one person giggle! Thats just a waste!	reddit-TacoPunchster	cipdxdr	And I was really looking forward to the discussion about the Reuben sandwich. Its one of my favorites and I hoped I might have learned something.	reddit-hey_wait_a_minute	cipe51j	Lol i laughed when I saw that thread I still dont know what a Reuben. Like a roast beef sandwich or something?
whowouldwin	ct8r8yw	> He can only absorb solar energy  Little known fact, he can absorb any energy that gives of heat in one form of another. Although this happens like three times in total its more of a plot power than anything else.	reddit-super_surfer	ct8rqxz	Seriously? Should we actually count that, though, or treat it as situational PIS? Also, while I dont doubt you, could I get a source for future reference?	reddit-Groudon466	ct8sbfz	Nah why would you count it. Its from Camelot Falls where he gets depowered and trapped in the earths core for several years and then regains his strength by absorbing the energy from the rocks, the heat and the pressure  Its from Superman v1 658, its not really something i would use. Its just a little known thing.
JusticePorn	c5d67wo	Protip: dont stab someone with a broken glass bottle like that, youll likely do more damage to your hand. 	reddit-lalilulelo09	c5d69uz	A protip would be not get in such a fucked up scenario in the first place.	reddit-satisfiedsardine	c5d6lmf	That too. Yet we still dont really know the context of this situation, the white guy could of been peacefully chilling by the pool and approached by these aggressors or he could have instigated it, we simply dont know.  
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	ctgzcr5	Im Danielle!      1. I was once lost in a canyon and it took a police helicopter, a team of fire fighters, and multiple police cars to find me.   2. I played soccer for 13 years growing up. I also used to figure skate.   3. I love love love miniature things and I own a lot of things that are min (like scissors) regardless of whether or not its practical just because I think they are cute! 	reddit-dryan0	ctgzllk	Your mini things are awesome!	reddit-shawnusaurus	ctgzpdo	Thank you!! I love them so much. I need more! 
Cricket	dkvvnqe	Yep - got lucky on 0 when he flashed one through the slips but hes been growing in confidence since. Adjusted his positioning at the crease to Philander too, which was encouraging to see. Playing nicely thus far, as is Westley.	reddit-WyldRover	dkvw0z3	Good to see, its nice to see an England batsman out of nick actually showing some grit and try to change things a bit to turn it around. Always reminds me of Strauss vs New Zealand when he was probably one innings away from being dropped and he just sat in and made probably one of the most uncomfortable looking centuries Ive ever seen.	reddit-NiallH22	dkvwtgo	Absolutely - Cook v Pakistan the summer before *that* Ashes is my favourite example of that. Imagine if the armchair selectors had got their way and Cook had been dropped before that winter...
wine	djxi084	Low cost and complimentary does not equal Napa Valley.   Like someone said, go to Sonoma or if Napa is where your hearts set on, save up your money. Just for yourself for tasting rooms youre looking at $20 per place minimum, not counting anything you buy.	reddit-enforcetheworld	djxqksh	I believe Heitz is still free to taste, and one of the best in Napa.	reddit-Twerp129	djxrt9m	You know what? Youre right, Heitz is free and absolutely one of the best. I forgot about them, but they are the exception and not the rule.
weddingplanning	csu1v2a	My moms dress had a removable train. It attached to the back with hooks then came off to reveal her floor length hem. Not sure if thats a possibility for yours.	reddit-socialsecurityguard	csu2bcs	Im trying to picture how that would look without it looking like an obvious added on piece of fabric.	reddit-spacechimp86	csu2sic	It looked like how a dress would if it were bustled, but had the train. And I think it was like a skirt with the waist sewn shut so when she walked, you wouldnt see a space between the dress and train.

tf2	djsy1h7	Aaaand the subreddit blew it out of proportion (again) and hell get unnecessary hate now. Good job.	reddit-kamild1996	djszpwm	Unnecessary?	reddit-Batby	djszv04	Yeah, unnecessary. As some other people mentioned here, its normal to be so paranoid after meeting so many hackers in one sitting.   Also check the comment section, theres a pinned comment with Aces response in it.
ICONOMI	djwzg11	Hello all! Dont forget that Iconomis Q2 report is going to be lackluster (at least compared to Q1) because of the past 3 weeks :)	reddit-sorceryofthetesticle	djx3k6g	Why lackluster? Couldnt buy back a lot because of the recent price increase?	reddit-Justinformation	djx3y9a	No, Im sitting pretty on my ICN investment.  The whole crypto market (including the Iconomi holdings) has dropped a significant amount since the last BTC all time high. Iconomis numbers will probably not be as spectacular as a lot of people here would hope. If thats true, there will be a lot of fear, and you know what fear does to traders/investors.
firefly	c24oj0k	I have this shirt, it fits me well.	reddit-appleswitch	c24oj9z	Awesome, my mistake! Expect another order soon. :) Thanks, appleswitch, for the good review (I was a little worried).	reddit-laryrose	c24ol51	I ordered it from RedBubble. I just checked the closet and its an American Apparel 100% cotton.
fountainpens	dkm7diw	Sounds like a leak.  Make sure the nib and feed are firmly seated.  Does any ink leak past the piston if you store it nib up?  Some silicone might help that.	reddit-efrankb3	dkm7iv9	Actually,now that you mention it, yes! There is a little bit of ink behind the piston.   Could that really be what is affecting the ink leaking out of the nib though? To me it seems like problems at opposite ends of the pen (though admittedly I dont know much about repair, restoration, or tuning).	reddit-MurderousMeerkat	dkm8wwq	If the piston is leaking ink will get behind it when its nib up, air will get past it when its nib down (allowing ink to leak out the nib).  Try adding some silicone grease to the piston.
BabyBumps	ct7ejba	I had dreams both times I got pregnant (before my missed period and then shortly after) about being pregnant.	reddit-themadchild	ct7gis8	Me, too! With my last pregnancy I dreamt I got a positive test and I started crying. I woke up and decided to take a test, and there were two lines. With my first pregnancy before I even knew, I had dreams that people were asking me to do things and I turned them down with the excuse that I was pregnant. 	reddit-GeneticOpera	ct7ibq2	The first time, there was a doctor explaining pregnancy after a dream-BFP. It eerily went like how my actual doctor visit went a few weeks later.  This time, I met my son.
Supernatural	ciseyqu	Except those comments are heavy with snark, the two jokes I know of come from Meg and Balthazar. Two sarcastic characters.	reddit-vic042	ciso5co	Actually Metatron and Uriel also make those comments and they arent sarcastic characters. 	reddit-hushkush23	cisw1b5	Uriel: Castiel? Oh hes, hes not here. You see he has this weakness, he likes you.  Uriel is hardly saying they are in love or boyfriends. And I dont recall Metatron saying anything to that effect about Cas and Dean.
islam	c5l636q	So dont agree with those guys drawing images of Companions of the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam.	reddit-Hightime2011	c5l6vlq	I guess you have a point.	reddit-Vogner	c5l8hke	Jazakallaahu khair. Apart from the hadith forbidding drawing images, one always wonders how noble, beautiful, handsome, modest and everything else the Companions must have looked.  No-one can do them justice by trying to draw them the way they imagine.  
food	ctl9i0l	I was good till you went full hipster.  Black beans with cilantro, and creamed corn.  I will upvote, because you probably had the cilantro from the toilet paper and human feces field in Mexico.	reddit-cherzing	ctlfarj	Yeah. Adding flavor to food definitely makes one a hipster.	reddit-dirtydiabetic	ctlnihw	It was your Hipster/Reddit descriptive attempt at making it look more appealing. Not because of the ingredients that you put in there.
FoodPorn	d4vs5fb	So I saw this post and said I must try that.  Then I found this recipe and tried that.  Not sweet enough, I think it lacks what looks to be a nice, chewy/crunchy bottom.  If anyone lives on the north shore of Chicago and wants to take some cookies off my hands...	reddit-Vite_Knight	d4vtzye	Ive had success with this recipe,  <link>   	reddit-chicken_pot	d4vv7j2	Thanks Ill give it a shot.

LightNovels	ct5xzkt	you do know that being anything below paragon compared to Beirut is shit?	reddit-llye	ct5y6q2	He can kick his ass without effort no doubt. I dont think he can pry through his memories without pretty much kicking his ass first and then immobilizing him. I dont think hed do that in the middle of this banquet.	reddit-TransitioningToVoat	ct5zl79	do you know what lvl Beirut is?
pokemon	d5qumr5	Keep your eyes and ears open through the end credits.  B2W2 has one of my favorite end credit sequences of any game.	reddit-DiamondIceNS	d5qxlp3	Huh? I own both copies.  What are you referring to?	reddit-dogmanx88	d5qy5vj	I just really like the end credits.  Im trying to not say too much since OP implies not being at that point yet.
Catholicism	djq22a6	That is so strange. He was saying that the obligation is to attend Sunday Mass, not just any Mass.	reddit-fr-josh	djq2hn3	Interesting that a canon lawyer would say that. For example, have you attended a Sunday ordination? Its not a Sunday Mass, but it fulfills. The canon doesnt say Mass with the Sunday proper, etc. Id be interested to hear his reasoning. 	reddit-balrogath	djq38ol	Nope. Ive only been on Saturday morning.
beyondthebump	dkthufq	My 6 week old will be up for up to 3 hours at a time and I can totally tell hes overtired...but he refuses to be coaxed to sleep. It drives us both crazy and his little cries make me feel so awful. 	reddit-IPAsmakemydickhard	dkti9pp	I feel your pain. 10 weeks here and I have to wear her and make sure she cant see anything or there is no sleep. 	reddit-seafoam_dreams	dktie9x	Thats something I havent tried actually! He usually falls asleep when I wear him and were out and about, so maybe wearing at home and walking around may do the trick?
quityourbullshit	cso5ros	Yeah, I dont know why people downvote some things. I stopped trying to understand years ago. Perhaps it was because I posted some responses at the top of this mess of comments, but who knows. I didnt take it as derogatory.	reddit-metalmartyr	cso5vn0	Thanks for being rational. 	reddit-JCBh9	cso61t2	I have my moments.
minnesota	dk1f51v	Paying everybody $15 will result in price increases.  Patrons might in turn lower or reduce their tipping.  After all, this takes away one of the main arguments for tipping, they make poverty wages so they need my tips	reddit-froynlavenfroynlaven	dk4xfu8	So of they lose $7.25 an hour in tips they will break even ?	reddit-DJpuar	dk5drxo	Nope.  If they give that money for the right to be tipped they will come out ahead.  Patrons wont consistently tip people making fifteen, that removes all justification for the tip
PoliticalDiscussion	cj9iehx	I would support a flat tax - $10K personal deduction and 10 percent of all income past that.   Someone making $40K/year would pay $3K in taxes. Someone making $200K/year would pay $19K.   Its fair all around. Everyone pays their share and thats that. 	reddit-Honky_Cat	cj9m4th	The problem is that 10% flat will leave the Federal government severely underfunded. Wed have to raise it higher to get close to a level needed to fund the government.	reddit-glberns	cj9mejf	And what would that level be?   If we get rich folks and corporations to actually pay their fair share, I think wed actually do OK at 10%
Ghosts	d5s0avx	Sure, maybe, but its also better to make sure a person with an illness is getting the help they need. Likely, this girl is having hallucinations and needs medical help. Leading her on could be dangerous.	reddit-TheNicholasRage	d5s0x7l	How am I leading her on? I agree with you, she needs medical help	reddit-DaisyIsMyWife	d5s17xt	I never said you were, I was responding to ZiShuDos suggestion of encouraging the behavior. I think youre both right and responsible in your disbelief, and I think ZiShuDo should probably see someone as well.
TumblrInAction	ctbv2j9	Came here to say that Im apparently the only person in the world who likes Teen Titans Go. I dont give a shit about the original, and I love the art.	reddit-holy_squid	ctc3xgo	Art style is fine, except when Batman or Commissionor Gordon is on screen when they look awful as a joke. Also I know they  completely redubed a scene from Trouble in Tokyo by putting kissing noises all over it, even if its supposed to be Robin dreaming.	reddit-Ghost5410	ctchfig	I didnt grow up with the original, so I dont have any strong feelings towards it. I can see how them dubbing over it as a joke might annoy some fans, though.
StarVStheForcesofEvil	ctf885q	Honestly every male version of Star i see just looks like Star with short hair	reddit-Damianx5	ctf9oxd	Yup to date I have never seen a convincing male Star. Still scary how easy it is to make marco a convincing looking girl tho haha.	reddit-Thatonesplicer	cth4d0j	Now i want an episode where Marco has to dress up like a girl for some reason... would be fun if Star would tell him You are a pretty girl Marco xD

I heard its as big as the lotr trilogy???	reddit-pandas795	ct49o0z	The original story, Fallout Equestria, is 620,295 words, compared to the LOTR trilogies being 481,103 according to this.	reddit-2woToned	ct49qc2	Wow! So is the main story all by one author or was it a collab? I know there are many side stories

Also he just shoved his face in my plate at one point.	reddit-notarelys	ciyg6rf	lol too funny! maybe cook some chicken without spices for him and give him a small bowl or plate at dinner time. I find it easier to eat when I feed my little monsters right before I eat.
lockpicking	d5y4bp4	Isnt the premise of the show that we only use 5% of our brains? The starting point is a fallacy, I dont expect details to be correct.	reddit-Anezay	d5y4krz	No, the premise is that the drug facilitates connections within the brain making it more efficient. They specifically state in the show that the 10 percent brain thing is a myth. That said, its still full of inaccuracies. Fun show though. 	reddit-Diskroll	d5y5b9q	Ah, ok, cool. Ive only seen the movie, assumed it was the same. You know what they say about when you assume: Make sure you have enough relevant data, first.
oneplus	dkr497t	I find N+ good for some things, especially the graphing or solving, but for general math, I find Calculator++ much better, if you put it in engineering mode.	reddit-0xTJ	dkr4omw	I totally disagree. N+ has a much cleaner interface with more functionality.	reddit-detroyer	dkr5aci	I did specify that Calc++ is better for general math, so Im just looking at regular scientific calculations for this. Calc++ has everything in the same buttons that you use on a simple calc.
windowsphone	cbbtfsx	The Lumia cameras really are great. Ive had people tell me lately you take such great pictures! Yup...I suuure do lol (I just point and shoot)	reddit-chrisjmc	cbbv223	Did you read the title? It says HTC 8X not the Lumia.	reddit-sponges789	cbbvksw	My apologies 
Guildwars2	c5l2yn2	Recently bought the Logitech G700 and Plantronics GameCom 367. Havent used them much yet but Ive heard nothing but good reviews about them.	reddit-_Seahaven	c5l86zi	I second the g700 it is a fabulous mouse, it can be had less on amazon.	reddit-sgpigeon	c5l8goe	Thats great to hear. I cant wait to use my new gear when GW2 launches!
Minecraft	cipswe8	There will be soon! Its Linux only until I find someone who knows how to compile on Windows and Mac. I need to add saving and loading, as well as walking and building and stuff. My main focus had been generation	reddit-ProvenDantheman	ciptjaf	Great! I will definitely be trying it out ASAP	reddit-StonesoulJr	ciptjy6	Theres more Id like to do with it first! :)
Gamingcirclejerk	djohzbu	I get annoyed everytime I see the logo for that fake Valenwood game, the emblem they use is the empires logo, and a game in valenwood would be shit because there is no towns or cities built there.	reddit-Superpixelmonkey	djokun4	Could be a survival-type game. Ive been thinking for a while that  Bethesda needs to branch out from their IPs being just RPGs, which they seem to also think since they made FO Shelter	reddit-TentaculoidBubblegum	djom24p	Itd work better as a spin off, even then bethesda as a publisher would probably hand it off to one of their other companies to make it
PS4	d5vjnmr	What does VR have to do with Neo?	reddit-ShelobTheGreat	d5vjze4	Supposedly better power to enhance the VR experience. It only makes sense that a more powerful console would allow a better experience with PSVR, and thats been the rumor.	reddit-ajs1850	d5vk16g	I guess. It on Ps4 is smooth and solid though.
dancegavindance	dkfnd6x	damn i wish i could have gone, i know how good they sound live :(	reddit-pocketspam	dkfnwnv	Yeah they did super good Im gonna upload Inspire and Summertime Gladness, I already got Lemon Meringue up. 	reddit-Bunku_The_Edge_Lord	dkfrh1n	oh sweet, i cant wait to hear it
Harley	ct7j81g	Are you so fat that you look ridiculous on one? Need a bigger bike to make you look smaller by comparison? 	reddit-FrumiousBantersnatch	ct7vm4j	No Im a man, thats why	reddit-Always422	ct82ru5	Hahaha. Sure thing you fat bastard. But dont worry, no one will know about your recessed micro dick - because your massive man harley will throw them off the scent. 
socialism	dkqxnnv	Its immoral, not amoral. Amoral means not having to do with morals	reddit-sarcasm24	dkqzfcx	Amoral means lacking moral sense, unconcerned with the rightness or wrongness of something, immoral means not conforming to accepted moral standards. The system that would restrict healthcare is amoral. The act itself is immoral.	reddit-orthag	dkqzsf5	He clearly means immoral
RandomActsofCards	csw5sgp	BTW - I felt like I recognized your name - then I realized, you are a fellow fountain pen enthusiast!  Reddit is a small world!	reddit-fae925	csw7h7r	Indeed it is! So you guys probably have blacklight lying around in case I accidentally use Blue Ghost? :)	reddit-edwinthedutchman	csw7kja	LOL  I dont...but I can buy one if there is a secret message hidden.  It would be like her very own magical adventure!   Edit - I wanted to add that I gave her a FP a few months ago - she loves and and may be converting!!  
creepyPMs	cb3wive	>I ask that you not interpret this in any way, shape, or form as being perverted  Fuck it makes me angry when people say shit like that. 	reddit-agoraphoebe	cb3wwyo	I know! They either have to be REALLY deluded, or REALLY (mistakenly) confident. Either way its ridiculous and they should be slapped or something.	reddit-energeticemily	cb3x5mz	Its like people who say Not to be racist buuutttt... or Not to be mean buuuttt...  If only that were a valid legal defense, then anyone could just be like *Heyyy* so like dont take this the wrong way and think Im mugging you or anything, but Im going to need you to give me all your money and valuables or, and you know dont freak out on me, Im going to shank you in the kidney.
EDM	cti9yjc	Why wouldnt he be allowed? I feel a bit out of the loop. I dont listen to him much.	reddit-killingstreak69	ctia34k	He hasnt DJed in any festival, but he is starting soon.	reddit-mfEDM	ctiady0	Ah I see, I know that no heroes and secrets are both pretty solid tracks and I think Jammu sounds alright too. He will make the list this year or next year.
Hookers	ciq677s	My girlfriend lives in Kansas and Im in Virginia. Weve been apart 3 months. Ive seen 2 escorts since she left. Im just filling a urge. Doesnt mean I dont love her any less nor will I ever tell her. 	reddit-Timmy2kx	cj8gedi	Id like to do this. But STDs worry me. Imagine catching an std and then giving it to youe gf. How do you manage this? 	reddit-RealHumanHere	cj8qc7m	Condoms. For everything.
Silverbugs	djrn06l	Suggestion: Since you have the lotus stamp on the bottom, I (and Im sure other people as well) would prefer to have those nice pour lines uninterrupted by a stamp and have them left bare.	reddit-vinberdon	djrn2ks	Thats cool. I can do them like that. On a couple the stamp is covering slight imperfections but on others there were no flaws to cover.	reddit-heavymetalpaul	djrn441	Imperfections give character to a piece just as much as nice pour lines do! I wouldnt worry about them (:
SubredditDrama	dkxrd4u	Any day now, right?	reddit-dank_radio	dkxu38k	It took two years for the Watergate investigation to produce a smoking gun.  But keep pretending every day you dont personally receive damning evidence that it vindicates Trump. Its not going to stop the investigation any.	reddit-zherok	dkxu4j7	🤷🏻‍♂️  Any day now.
cheatatmathhomework	d50vy4j	/u/xxwerdxx gave the proof, but heres a tip: try to imagine the graph in your head, and drawing the line *g(x)*, and see at what points theyll intersect, if any.	reddit-MoonwalkingKoopas	d50wyl1	Also 2x^(2)+1 > 2x everywhere	reddit-xxwerdxx	d50x1sd	Whoops, I assumed f(x) was x^2 +1. My bad, sorry :X
Stellaris	dka79p2	Sounds like a neat idea except the AI knows where everything is all the time, and youd just be hamstringing yourself. Could be ok in multiplayer.	reddit-MephistosGhost	dka7hp8	citation needed.	reddit-Thachyo	dka8fm9	For what, that the AI knows where everything is?
starcraft	c5har6h	Wow. Now i REALLY have to go to Stockholm for the euro-finals! 	reddit-Wizard_McMuffin	c5haxr0	are there more details on exactly where they are? might be a good chance to go to sweden this year (otherwise, dreamhack next year).	reddit-gslavik	c5hb5hv	Only info i have found is that they are in stockholm, and the date! And YES dreamhack next year. Youve seen the arena right? :D
dayz	dkx43nq	I applied 1 week ago, and got accepted last night, its something within your application.	reddit-CitrusPunchhh	dkxguib	Yeah I just wish they would give any kind of feedback to help me in the future for my next one. That part is the worst	reddit-mabo516	dkxmqyy	Yeah I understand. Dont give up. 
Libertarian	d5p4nw6	>A vote for a libertarian in this selection isnt going to come from a republican. They will not waver from electing their nominee.  How? Gary Johnsons Libertarian Party holds largely a moderate republican platform. Why would any sensible democrat vote for him?	reddit-CyonHal	d5p5p34	Sensible democrats wouldnt.	reddit-mildlyfunnycommenter	d5p6d2y	So is Johnson just relying on ignorance to garner voters? Johnson can be appealing to democrats at face value until you read about his stances on issues.
beer	dkf8u4x	From NY over here....  We had a local brewery (Mustache Brewing Company) come out with pumpkin beer....in June....	reddit-Sheesh15	dkgzouc	To be fair, its called Seasonal Creep and is meant to be reserved until fall.	reddit-uncleozzy	dkgzr9u	Well, they were promoting it and selling it in June lol. 
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	cb7oulm	No cake day yet but soon!!! So I baked you a cake on my kindle, which then led to this song in my head....  If I knew that you were coming, I woulda baked a cake, in my way bake...... (insert singing and stuff) :)	reddit-mouthie	cb7ovvw	Love it! Thanks :)	reddit-Sieberella	cb7p10e	Im no artist lol but yw and happy cake day dear تتت
australia	d5wn9ik	Rights are a bit thin when theres no agreement and you dont pay up	reddit-Dissatisfied_potato	d5wr1ce	Regardless...there is no justification for damaging property or stealing a passport. If the landlord doesnt have the intellectual capacity to find better solutions then they need to stop renting rooms.	reddit-shitevendor	d5ws7ej	Definitely not I see the property damage is now mutual so no winners here. 
Persona5	djwzo8g	He doesnt say every profanity as far as I know - I dont remember him saying Cunt, for instance.  He might just not like it. I swear like a sailor, but I really dislike the gendered way Bitch is used, so I just refer to jerks off any gender as Assholes.	reddit-enleft	djx66w3	Ill never understand the whole Its not ok to say bitch because its gendered. You know who uses gendered words? Dicks and pricks! thing.  Besides, Fuck is the worst possible swear because its derived from Focker, a type of plane Hitlers guys used to fuck shit up during WW2.	reddit-CleverestPony70	djx77zh	I use asshole, which everyone has.  I dont like the way it means bossy for women and weak for men.  I didnt say no one can use it - I said I dont use it. Just like I choose other words for other reasons. If other people use them, thats their choice.
BackYardChickens	dkrvfvj	Meet Charlotte - she is my lone blue cochin (lives with some silver laced wyandottes, a buff orpington, a red sex link, and a blue brahma)  She is quite timid - but will come quite close for some cheese	reddit-lovetheduns	dks896u	She needs a floofy friend!  I have two blue Cochins in with a random assortment and they love to chill together.  Plus... why wouldnt you want more of them??	reddit-zombievettech	dkssv1g	Well my barn owner has a lot of cochins (white and blue) in her brooder.. so maybe I will get another.   Lord help me in my little paddock that means with my new blue brahma coming that would be 7 chickens with a new cochin
metalgearsolid	cb9elz0	I really hope that MGO 3 will have the same feel and community as MGO 2!	reddit-Darkkota	cb9mtxe	I cant wait [for both MGO3 and the actual game] and I really hope that the LA Studio doesnt try and CoD-ify the game... keep MGO as MGO.	reddit-eatingcrayonz	cb9qqca	I agree, Im way too excited!
sex	c58mudc	Talk to your partner. It different with different women. The best thing to do would be to talk to her about (you could get some fun sexting out of it). Then when you actually start to go down on her, tell her to let you know what she likes. Youll figure it out pretty quickly if you have open lines of communication. And oh ya, PRACTICE ;)	reddit-sassafras30	c58rzja	Yeah, I should talk to her first But I justvwanted to surprise her, so I was asking here first.	reddit-stupid_stupid_name	c5907gu	It could still be a surprise when you actually do it. Just make sure its a surprise thats welcome. Talk to her then if she says its ok then wait a while then go for it. Its really great of you to want to please her in this fashion :)
stevenuniverse	d5sczxr	Dat Astroboy Reference in the first dream sequence tho  ---  edit: for people who dont get it  	reddit-blissando	d5sdf1r	?? Edit: Just realized youre the same person who did a similar post just now. Youre really terrible at explaining things. :P	reddit-Ree81	d5sdox8	Lol Im not terrible at explaining things, youre just not good at picking up what Im putting down. Let me lay it on thick.  Tezukas Astroboy is an extremely influential early anime character. Hes a boy robot with jet-propulsion feet and robo arm cannons.  Edit: Also if that wasnt blunt enough Steven is pretty much in the iconic Astroboy pose in the promo art.
theydidthemath	ct1wnv0	Have you tried non superhero comics? Some of my personal favorites are Saga, Black Science, Deadly Class, Descender, Lazarus and Southern Bastards. If not, and you are so inclined, you may find something you enjoy!	reddit-6-8_Yes_Size15	ct1wwtk	Y The Last Man, and Transmetropolitan should be on this list. Especially the latter.	reddit-Rionoko	ct1x85t	Havent read them, but I have heard of them. I probably should give them a try.
SVExchange	ctmuma6	Sorry for the mix up in schedules yesterday, Ill be off and on today, so just let me know when you are available and I will try to match.	reddit-Gruuler	ctmxfwl	Im available form now for 5 hours.	reddit-r-scarlet	ctmxpc4	Okay, hoping on.  EDIT: Online and waiting.
Ultralight	d5ai56d	Walmart has them.  They are in the cookware section though, not camping.  All of the Imusa stuff is grouped together.    	reddit-jboyinja13	d5b1qf8	Thats where Ive seen them as well, but they where about five or six bucks.	reddit-mrjowee	d5b3z1s	Interesting.  Just picked up a 10 cm and 12 cm for about 3 bucks a piece in NC.
